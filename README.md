# Active Directory Home Lab with PowerShell

## Description
This project involved setting up an Active Directory (AD) home lab environment using PowerShell to simulate a real-world domain setup. The lab consisted of two virtual machines (a server and a client) to demonstrate user management, group policy configuration, and automation of administrative tasks.

## Actions
- Set up a Windows Server virtual machine (VM) as the Domain Controller (DC) and configured Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
- Created a Windows 10 client VM and joined it to the domain.
- Used PowerShell to automate the creation of users, groups, and Organizational Units (OUs) in Active Directory.
- Configured Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security policies, such as password complexity and account lockout settings.
- Implemented PowerShell scripts to manage AD objects, including bulk user creation, group membership management, and password resets.
- Tested and validated the functionality of the domain environment by logging in with domain user accounts and applying GPOs.

## Tools
- **Virtualization**: VirtualBox.
- **Operating Systems**: Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller), Windows 10 (Client).
- **Scripting**: PowerShell for automation and AD management.
- **Active Directory**: AD DS, GPOs, OUs, user/group management.

## Outcome
- Successfully built a functional Active Directory environment, demonstrating the ability to manage and automate domain operations.
- Gained hands-on experience with PowerShell scripting for AD administration, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.
- Enhanced understanding of domain security policies and user management in a Windows Server environment.
